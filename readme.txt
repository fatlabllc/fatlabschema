Schema markup that knows when to say no. Intelligent wizard guides you to correct schema implementation optimized for AI search.

== Description ==

**Finally, a schema plugin that tells you when you DON'T need schema!**

FatLab Schema Wizard is different from every other schema plugin. Instead of assuming every page needs schema markup, it asks intelligent questions and explicitly tells you when schema isn't needed. This prevents incorrect implementations and keeps your site clean.

**Why 10 schema types instead of 35+?**

Most schema plugins overwhelm you with 35+ schema types, but here's the truth: only about 10 schema types actually matter for SEO and AI citations. The rest are either too specialized, not supported by search engines for rich results, or simply not used by AI assistants when citing sources.

We focus exclusively on the schemas that deliver real results:
- Recognized by Google for rich results
- Used by AI assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot) for citations
- Proven to improve click-through rates
- Actually relevant for most websites

Less decision paralysis. Better results.

= The 10 Schema Types That Actually Matter =

These are the only schema types that consistently deliver SEO value and AI citation benefits:

1. **Organization / NGO** - For nonprofits, advocacy groups, political organizations, businesses
2. **LocalBusiness** - Physical offices, campaign headquarters, retail stores
3. **FAQPage** - FAQ pages, policy positions, campaign stances
4. **Event** - Fundraisers, rallies, town halls, volunteer events, webinars
5. **Service** - Services offered by businesses or nonprofits
6. **Article / ScholarlyArticle** - Blog posts, research papers, policy white papers

5. Fill in the schema details

= Conflict Detection =

FatLab Schema Wizard automatically detects when other SEO plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, All in One SEO) are adding schema to your pages. It will warn you about conflicts and help you avoid duplicate schema markup that can harm your SEO.

= Developer Friendly =

* Clean, well-documented code following WordPress standards
* Extensive hooks and filters for customization
* REST API endpoints for advanced integrations
* Compatible with WordPress multisite

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/fatlabschema`, or install through the WordPress plugins screen
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > FatLab Schema to configure your Organization schema (required first step)
4. Edit any page or post and use the Schema Wizard meta box to add schema

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need this if I already have Yoast/Rank Math/AIOSEO? =

Yes, if you need Event, Service, HowTo, FAQ, or specialized schema types! Those SEO plugins handle basic Article schema well, but they don't support the other schema types that generate rich results. FatLab Schema Wizard fills the gaps with the 10 schemas that actually matter. Our conflict detection ensures you don't create duplicate schema.

= Why only 10 schema types? Other plugins have 35+! =

That's the point! Most schema types don't deliver value. We focus exclusively on the schemas proven to generate rich results in Google or get used by AI assistants for citations. The rest are either too specialized, not supported for rich results, or ignored by search engines and AI. Quality over quantity means you spend time on schemas that actually help your site.

= What if my page doesn't need schema? =

That's perfectly fine! The wizard will tell you when schema isn't needed. Not every page needs schema markup - it's only beneficial for specific content types.

= Will this work with my theme? =

Yes! FatLab Schema Wizard works with any properly coded WordPress theme. The schema is added to your page's HTML as JSON-LD, which is theme-independent.

= Does this help with Google search rankings? =

Schema markup doesn't directly improve rankings, but it helps search engines understand your content better, which can lead to rich results (enhanced search listings with extra information). Rich results typically get higher click-through rates.

= How do I know if my schema is working? =

Use Google's Rich Results Test (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to validate your schema. The wizard also includes a preview feature to check your JSON-LD before publishing.

= Is this optimized for AI search engines like ChatGPT? =

Yes! Properly structured schema helps AI assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot) understand and cite your content more accurately.

= Can I use this on a multisite network? =

Yes! Each site in your network can have its own Organization schema and page-level schema.
